#Input: a list
#Output: Return the two halves as different lists.
#If the input list has an odd number, the middle item can go to either list.

a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

#note for self: // is for integer divison in python (opposed to float)
#useful here for finding the midpoint because it doesn't take remainder
split_point = (len(a_list)- 1) // 2

#print(split_point)    test print

front_half = a_list[:split_point]
back_half = a_list[split_point:]

print(front_half)
print(back_half)


#debriefing:
    #for this one the main thing was to find the halfway point of the list
    #remember that when using brackets to split a list, the side with the-
    #-number on it is the point that gets cut off
